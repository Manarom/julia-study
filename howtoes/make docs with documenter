1. Install Documenter.jl
2. In project parent directory add the folder ".\docs\"
3. Add folder ".\docs\src\", it should contain "index.md" and other *.md files with description of tabs
4. Create file make.jl in the ".\docs\" folder. Example of make.jl file content:
    #begin_of_make.jl_file
        push!(LOAD_PATH,"../src/")
        include("../src/BandPyrometry.jl") # modules should be available for make.jl namespace
        using Documenter,.BandPyrometry # modules should be available for make.jl namespace
        mathengine = Documenter.MathJax3() # this is for latex interpretation
        makedocs(
                sitename = "BandPyrometry.jl",
                highlightsig = false,
                checkdocs = :none,
                format=Documenter.HTML(size_threshold = 2000 * 2^10),
                pages=[
                        "Home" => "index.md" 
                        "Examples"=>["BandPyrometry"=>"pluto_tests_git.md"
                                    "Planck" =>"pluto_tests_git.md"
                        ]
                        "Modules" => [
                            "Planck" =>"planck.md"
                            "BandPyrometry" => "bandpyrometry.md"
                            "Pyrometers" => "pyrometers.md"
                            "JDXreader" => "jcamp-reader.md"
                        ] 
                    ]#
                    )
        #deploydocs(;
        #         repo="github.com/Manarom/BandPyrometry"
        #)
    #end_of_make.jl_file
5. Example of index.md file:

    #begin_of_make.jl_file
        # BandPyrometry.jl
        ## General description

            ```@raw html
            <p>Detailed description of the underlying mathematics is available at:<a href="assets/supplementary_v_0_0_1.pdf">Download PDF</a>.</p
            ```

            - Planck.jl module contains several functions to evaluate: 
                - Blackbody spectral intensity (Planck function)
                - The first and the second derivatives of Planck function with respect to the wavelength and temperature 
                - Planck function fast integration over the specified wavelength region

6. To automatically generate doc from source files md - file should contain:
    # Functions for blackbody thermal emission (and its derivatives) calculation

        ```@autodocs
            Modules = [Planck]
            Order   = [:function, :type]
        ```
7. After creating all files, run "julia --project make.jl" from ".\docs\" parent directory, this 
command will create folder ".\docs\build\"
8. To add some files like pdf's or figures add them to ".\docs\src\assets\" directory the content of this directory 
will be copied to the ".\docs\build\assets" folder to reference e.g. ".\docs\src\assets\file.pdf" the following 
code in the *.md file can be used:
        ```@raw html
        <p>Detailed description....:<a href="assets/1.pdf">Download PDF</a>.</p
        ```
